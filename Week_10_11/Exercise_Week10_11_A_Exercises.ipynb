    "Transcription in mammals often requires a more complicated telegraph model (promoter cycle), where the promoter state goes through an $ON$ state, and then sequentially goes through several $OFF_n$ state before returning to the ON state. For example with two $OFF$ states, it would look like: $ON\\,(g=1)\\longrightarrow OFF_1 (g=2) \\longrightarrow OFF_2 (g=3) \\longrightarrow ON (g=1)$. This is related to the fact that transcription events often show a refractory period, *i.e.* promoter tend to say off for some amount of time before turning back on. \n",

Show some representative simulations. Plot both the mRNA and promoter state and comment.\n",
