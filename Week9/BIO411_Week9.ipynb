    "## **Temperature regulates splicing efficiency of the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein gene _Cirbp_**\n",
    "This week’s exercises are based on the work of [Gotic et al., 2015](http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/30/17/2005), which explores how core body temperature (CBT) rhythms influence diurnal gene expression, focusing on the role of the protein Cirbp.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mammals, core body temperature (CBT) fluctuates diurnally around a mean value of 36°C–37°C. While the period of circadian rhythms is stable under temperature changes, the phase of the cycle is highly sensitive to (even small) temperature shifts. For instance, in cultured fibroblasts, the phase of circadian gene expression can be synchronized with simulated CBT cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper investigates how CBT rhythms might synchronize gene expression, possibly through temperature-sensitive proteins. One such protein, Cirbp (Cold-Inducible RNA-Binding Protein), shows increased mRNA levels at lower temperatures. The authors aim to understand the mechanisms behind this temperature-sensitive response.\n",
    "\n",
    "They explore different ways mRNA regulation could change with temperature, including:\n",
    "- Increased Cirbp transcription at lower temperatures\n",
    "- Reduced degradation of Cirbp mRNA at lower temperatures\n",
    "- Enhanced pre-mRNA splicing efficiency at lower temperatures\n",
    "  \n",
    "Through various experiments (RNase protection assays, ChIP assays, luminescence assays), the authors rule out transcriptional and degradation regulation, showing that increased pre-mRNA splicing efficiency is key to the higher Cirbp mRNA accumulation at lower temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experimental design**\n",
    "In these exercises, we will focus on one of the experiments that led to this conclusion. The authors used an “approach to steady-state” (ATSS) RNA-seq technique to examine genome-wide transcription and mRNA accumulation after temperature changes.  Specifically, NIH3T3 cells were exposed to a temperature change (either from 33°C to 38°C or from 38°C to 33°C) and collected at various time points after the shift. Total RNA was then extracted, ribosomal RNA was removed, and cDNA libraries were sequenced. This method enabled the authors to measure both pre-mRNA and mRNA levels across the entire genome.\n",

    "\n",
    "*\"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that simplifies complex datasets by transforming them into a set of orthogonal axes, or principal components (PCs), that summarize the underlying patterns of variation. It works by calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the covariance matrix of the data, which then define the new axes. The first principal component captures the largest amount of variance in the data, with each subsequent component—perpendicular to the last—capturing progressively less variance. This orthogonal nature of PCA ensures that each component adds distinct information. This means that all the PCs are uncorrelated to each other. When applied to gene expression data, PCA reduces the numerous gene variables to a few composite indicators without losing critical information. After transformation, each principal component represents a combination of genes. The loadings of these components then tell us about the contribution of each gene to the component. Genes with high absolute loadings have a greater role in defining the structure revealed by that component, allowing us to identify which genes are most responsible for differentiating the samples on the basis of the observed variance.\"*\n",
